Recap on Attribute based RBAC : 
How will you handle resource -specific permissions?
**** BAC and attribute based access control ****

In some systems, permissions may not be tied to a userâ€™s general role, but to a specific resource. For example, a manager might be allowed to edit one project but not others. ( JIRA best example )
another example is : An editor can edit certain documents, but only view others.

possible mini solution : 
// Hypothetical resource-level permissions model
const resourcePermissions = [
    { resourceId: 1, userId: 2, permissions: ['edit'] },  // User 2 can edit Resource 1
    { resourceId: 2, userId: 2, permissions: ['view'] },  // User 2 can view Resource 2
];

// Check user permissions for a specific resource
function checkResourcePermission(userId, resourceId, action) {
    const permission = resourcePermissions.find(rp => rp.resourceId === resourceId && rp.userId === userId);
    return permission?.permissions.includes(action);
}
